This file should be used to describe what our various programs should do for the sake of documentation.

ExtractData.py:
    ->Select a directory to analyze
    ->Choose to sort the entries (Should always sort when intending to use the MoveStuff.py)
    ->Display a graph with the data
        ->Blue lines represent the training data
        ->Orange lines represent the test data
    ->Save to "output.txt" the data of a predefined interval of classes
    ->Output to console the same predefined set ⩤maybe we should make it settable at runtime?⩥

MoveStuff.py
    ->Read from "output.txt" what folders need to be moved
    ->Move the folders into a new/existing empty folder
    ->The name of the folder is chosen by the user at runtime
    ->Will move both the training and testing variants of the data
